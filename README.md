# üè† Seoul Real Estate Price Prediction

## 1. Project Overview
This repository predicts **transaction prices (‚ÄúÎ¨ºÍ±¥Í∏àÏï°‚Äù) for properties in Seoul** using official real estate data.  
We:
- Preprocess the training and test datasets separately,
- Train multiple machine learning models,
- Select the best-performing model,
- Output predictions for the test data in `submission.csv`.

## 3. Dataset
- **Source:** 2024 Seoul Real Estate Transaction Data (as of 2024.09.13)  
- **Train Set:** 64,016 rows √ó 21 columns  
- **Test (submission) Set:** 7,116 rows √ó 21 columns  
- **Target Variable:** `Î¨ºÍ±¥Í∏àÏï°` (transaction price, in 10,000 KRW)

### Key Features
- `ÏûêÏπòÍµ¨Î™Ö`: District name (Í∞ïÎÇ®Íµ¨, ÏÑúÏ¥àÍµ¨, ÎßàÌè¨Íµ¨, ‚Ä¶)  
- `Í±¥Î¨ºÎ©¥Ï†Å`, `ÌÜ†ÏßÄÎ©¥Ï†Å`: Building & land area (m¬≤)  
- `Ï∏µ`: Floor number  
- `Í±¥Ï∂ïÎÖÑÎèÑ`: Year built  
- `Í±¥Î¨ºÏö©ÎèÑ`: Housing type (Îã®ÎèÖÎã§Í∞ÄÍµ¨, ÏïÑÌååÌä∏, Ïó∞Î¶ΩÎã§ÏÑ∏ÎåÄ, Ïò§ÌîºÏä§ÌÖî)  
- `Í∂åÎ¶¨Íµ¨Î∂Ñ`: Rights info (ÏûÖÏ£ºÍ∂å, Î∂ÑÏñëÍ∂å)  
- `Ïã†Í≥†Íµ¨Î∂Ñ`: Transaction type (Ï§ëÍ∞úÍ±∞Îûò, ÏßÅÍ±∞Îûò)

> **Note:** All data used here is publicly available from the Seoul Open Data platform.

## 4. Data Preprocessing
The notebooks `preprocessing_estate.ipynb` and `preprocessing_submission.ipynb` implement the following pipeline:

### 4.1 Missing Value Handling
- **Numeric columns**: filled with median or zero depending on domain knowledge  
- **Categorical columns**: filled with ‚ÄúUnknown‚Äù or most frequent category  

### 4.2 Feature Engineering
- **Building Age**: calculated from `Í±¥Ï∂ïÎÖÑÎèÑ`  
- **Contract Year/Month**: extracted from `Í≥ÑÏïΩÏùº`  
- **Floor Category**: grouped `Ï∏µ` into low/mid/high ranges to reduce sparsity  

### 4.3 Encoding
- **Label Encoding** for ordinal categorical variables  
- **One-Hot Encoding** for nominal variables with a small number of categories (e.g., `Í±¥Î¨ºÏö©ÎèÑ`, `Í∂åÎ¶¨Íµ¨Î∂Ñ`)  

### 4.4 Outlier Handling
- Removed or capped extreme values for `Í±¥Î¨ºÎ©¥Ï†Å` and `ÌÜ†ÏßÄÎ©¥Ï†Å`  
- Checked distribution of `Î¨ºÍ±¥Í∏àÏï°` and filtered obvious errors  

### 4.5 Target Transformation
- **Log transformation** applied to the target variable `Î¨ºÍ±¥Í∏àÏï°` to stabilize variance and improve model performance  
- During prediction, the inverse transformation (exp) is applied to return to the original scale  

### 4.6 Consistency Between Train/Test
- Ensured the same encoding and feature engineering steps applied to both training and submission datasets  
- Saved transformers/encoders from train preprocessing and reused them for submission preprocessing

## 5. Modeling
`model.ipynb` implements and compares multiple regression models:
- Random Forest Regressor  
- XGBoost Regressor  
- CatBoost Regressor  
- KNeighbors Regressor  

We used cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.  
The model with the **lowest RMSE on the validation set** was selected as the final model.

---

## 6. Evaluation Metric
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**  
  - Measures the difference between predicted and actual transaction prices.  
  - Lower RMSE means more accurate predictions.  
  - This was the official competition metric.

Example interpretation:  
If RMSE = 1,500 ‚Üí on average the prediction is off by about **1,500 √ó 10,000 KRW = 15 million KRW**.
